# ENSE 374 Group Project
ENSE 374 group project by group 9.

Under the theme of eHealth, group 9 created a command-line based application for
tracking alerts and notifications, and managing doctor's appointments. The application is by no means intended for real-world use and is just a simplified model for the purpose of studying agile development using the Scrum methodology, OOP principles, and collaboration with multiple team members.
